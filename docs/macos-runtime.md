# macOS Runtime Design (Apple Silicon)

This project supports macOS by publishing a Lima template that provisions an arm64 Ubuntu Minimal VM through Apple's Virtualization framework.

Primary entrypoint:

```bash
limactl start \
  --set '.param.COMPANY_CODE="your_company"' \
  github:overvenus/corplink-headless/lima/corplink-headless
```

For guest shell commands, use `LIMA_WORKDIR=/` so Lima does not try to `cd` into an unmapped host path.

## Why this design

- Users no longer need to clone the repository or run a repo-local VM wrapper script.
- Lima owns instance lifecycle directly, which keeps the user-facing flow to a single `limactl start`.
- Tagged releases publish a stable arm64 runtime tarball, so the guest can bootstrap from release artifacts instead of host mounts.
- The guest stack still mirrors the Docker runtime: Feilian service, `corplink-headless`, `socks5`, `privoxy`, supervisor-managed helpers, and the same NAT behavior.

## Release flow

On every pushed Git tag, GitHub Actions now:

- Builds and pushes a multi-arch Docker image for `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`.
- Builds `corplink-headless` and `socks5` for `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`.
- Packages each architecture into a release tarball together with `install_service.sh` and `startup.sh`.
- Publishes the tarballs plus a checksum file as GitHub Release assets.

The Docker publish job expects repository secrets `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` and `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN`.

The Lima template always downloads:

- `https://github.com/overvenus/corplink-headless/releases/latest/download/corplink-headless-runtime-linux-arm64.tar.gz`
- `https://github.com/overvenus/corplink-headless/releases/latest/download/corplink-headless-runtime-sha256sum.txt`
- `https://cdn.isealsuite.com/linux/FeiLian_Linux_arm64_v2.1.27_r2711_d2baf1.deb`

## Runtime parity with Docker

Inside the guest, the provision step installs and runs:

- `/opt/Corplink/corplink-service` from the official arm64 `.deb`
- `/opt/Corplink/corplink-headless` from the release tarball
- `/usr/local/bin/socks5` from the release tarball
- `privoxy` on guest `8118`, forwarded to host `8888`
- `socks5` on guest `1080`, forwarded to host `1088`
- `systemd` for the top-level `/startup.sh` lifecycle
- `supervisord` for `corplink-service`, `corplink-headless`, `privoxy`, `socks5`, `fixdns`, and `fixsshmtu`

`privoxy.service` and `supervisor.service` are masked in the guest so only `startup.sh` and supervisor own those processes.

## Key files

- `lima/corplink-headless.yaml`
  - Public Lima template consumed via the `github:` source.
- `lima/provision-system.sh`
  - Guest provisioning script that downloads the latest runtime bundle and official Feilian package, then calls `install_service.sh`.
- `scripts/install_service.sh`
  - Shared installer used by both Docker builds and the Lima/macOS guest runtime.
- `scripts/package_runtime.sh`
  - Builds and packages release tarballs for `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`.
- `.github/workflows/release.yml`
  - Tag-triggered workflow for Docker images, runtime bundles, and GitHub Release assets.
